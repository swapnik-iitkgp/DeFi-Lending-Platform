# DeFi-Lending-Platform
I created this repository to share the code for a decentralized lending and borrowing dapp built on Ethereum. The dapp allows users to borrow ETH against a NFT collateral as well as earn interest on lending ETH to the platform for a given duration in a transparent manner using blockchain and smart contracts.

The technology stack used for this project includes Solidity, Javascript, Truffle, Ethers.js, React.js, Chakra UI, Wagmi, and RainbowKit.

To engage with the dapp, you will need the following: NodeJS, Ganache, Truffle, and a wallet (Metamask, Rainbow, CoinbaseWallet, or WalletConnect).

The repository also includes instructions on how to set up and deploy the dapp.

Decentralized lending and borrowing dapp: This means that the dapp is not controlled by any central authority. Instead, it is governed by a set of smart contracts that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This makes the dapp more secure and transparent, as it is not subject to the whims of any individual or organization.

Borrow ETH against a NFT collateral: This means that users can borrow ETH from the dapp by providing NFTs as collateral. This allows users to access liquidity without having to sell their NFTs.

Earn interest on lending ETH to the platform: This means that users can lend ETH to the dapp and earn interest on 
their investment. This is a way for users to earn passive income by providing liquidity to the platform.

The dapp is secured using smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are stored on the blockchain. This makes them tamper-proof and irreversible, which makes the dapp more secure.

The benefits of using a decentralized lending and borrowing dapp, such as security, transparency, and censorship resistance.
The target audience for the dapp, such as crypto enthusiasts, NFT collectors, and borrowers.
The future plans for the dapp, such as adding new features or expanding to other blockchains.
